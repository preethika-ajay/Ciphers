# CIPHERS

Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it, and those who are not authorized cannot. 

Our program is a collection of simple ciphers - Enigma, Ceaser, Atbash, Playfair and vigenere, that encrypt messages with the required rules. 

<b>To know more about the Ciphers, refer to the respective .txt files. </b> 

The program uses simple C++ concepts such as arrays and basic logical operations.
